A company that has too much debt (in the range of 70%-90%) suffers high debt costs, which might lead to unnecessarily high WACC. On the opposite, a company that has plenty of equity suffers high equity costs due to the an risk-bearing minimum rate of return. The perfect capital structure might lead to minimal WACC due to fully exploiting the risk-free interest rate while simultaneously remaining the ability to meet its financial obligations\n","\n","- From a wider economic perspective, it is suggested that companies realistically set their WACC as the minimum rate of return on their investment projects. Therefore, we assess that relation of investment ratios and the disclosed WACC. We aim to see some inverse relations, i.e. the higher the WACC, the lower the investment ratio, the lower the economic value add.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dClwPt6SYKcu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Create Finance and Investment Analysis Dashboard"],"metadata":{"id":"0l80rBQXgOVJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["wacc.head()\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":377},"id":"CXRhicQgy41Y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645782116994,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":69,"user":{"displayName":"Simon Frey","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"05132761570616489161"}},"outputId":"2de13281-36c3-4d19-800d-023c87def060"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-f15f84c3-77f3-4c88-aa3f-1864770fc376\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Company</th>\n","      <th>Sector</th>\n","      <th>Industry</th>\n","      <th>WACC_cMR</th>\n","      <th>WACC_15yMR</th>\n","      <th>WACC_10yMR</th>\n","      <th>WACC_FS_aT</th>\n","      <th>WACC_FS_bT</th>\n","      <th>CAPM_cMR</th>\n","      <th>CAPM_15yMR</th>\n","      <th>CAPM_10yMR</th>\n","      <th>Beta</th>\n","      <th>Risk_free_interest</th>\n","      <th>Balance_sum</th>\n","      <th>Equity_book</th>\n","      <th>Debt_book</th>\n","      <th>Equity_ratio_book</th>\n","      <th>Debt_ratio_book</th>\n","      <th>Total_assets_market</th>\n","      <th>Market_cap</th>\n","      <th>Debt_costs_interestbearing</th>\n","      <th>Equity_ratio_market</th>\n","      <th>Debt_ratio_market</th>\n","      <th>Debt_costs_total</th>\n","      <th>Interest_expense</th>\n","      <th>Debt_interestbearing</th>\n","      <th>Tax_rate</th>\n","      <th>Market_return_average</th>\n","      <th>Market_return_annual</th>\n","      <th>Market_return_10year_rolling</th>\n","      <th>Investment_ratio</th>\n","      <th>Revenue</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Year</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2004</th>\n","      <td>Adidas AG</td>\n","      <td>Consumer Cyclical</td>\n","      <td>Footwear &amp;
